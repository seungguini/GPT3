  You should be more worried about what will happen if you don't.
  I know. Your description was correct. Um, the thing is, um, I think you might've misspoken about your brother. His room was actually right next to the bathroom. And that's probably why he found the cockroach…
  I’m in my apartment.
  I can't find a cheaper option than $450 for a plane ticket.
  Nothing is as it seems anymore. 
  You know, your part of the deposit that we needed to pay for the house.
  Get your cheque.
  I'm stuck in the same situation. It is such a shame that these corporations do not care about their workers.
  Well, when did you last use it?
  How did the earthquake happen?
  What’s your favorite song?
 Humph!
  Okay. Do you have a membership card already?
  
  
  Does Person2 watch it?
  Oh, of course.
  Yeah, one of them says trash & Recycle on it.
  So, was he just the only black guy?
  You think so?
  Because they're not like birds and they're carnivores and I don't like eating meat.
  Then please wear your shoes on.
  There are rides.
  What she said really hit home for me.
  We just wanted your advice on what to do about the neighbour.
  Every person has his own favourite player.
  But I don't drink.
  I heard that the price of lychee is going down.
  But you would have been good at it.
  What time is it there?
  Are you really good at dancing?
  We can go out for a drink.
  That’s great.
  You aren't listening to me.
  I don't know whether ketchup tastes better than mustard.
  The North Korean regime is a laughing stock.
  Were you responsible at work?
  Sarah is very good.
  It's worse than you think. You have all of your clothes on the floor! You have your toys all over the place. You have papers lying all over the ground!
  Wow, you really need to lose weight.
  But how do you mean?
  I can see that.
  Is watching others' games enough to win?
  50 million is nearly a 10% majority of the population.
  I disagree. I think it's 70.
  Yeah, but-'
  Where is "go" used in this story?
  It must have been embarrassing.
  How can you not like your new job?
  No. 
  You are going to fast.
  A "bounced" check is a check a person writes but the bank doesn't pay.
  All of them were breathtakingly beautiful.
  What's the problem?
  Me, too. I love boiled peanuts.
  I'm sure you are aware, but we are conducting an inspection.
 Yes.
  How did you do on your test?
  Sorry. I can ask if you want me to find one for you.
  It doesn't matter, I'm on a diet.
  You said it yourself.
  I think they searched everybody in line.
  Their relationship is unpleasant! They should have a divorce before having a child.
  Are you kidding me? Look how small the lines are. Who's going to see those?
  You need to board the bus for East Montebello.
  So, I hear that you are having problems with depression. Is that correct?
  What drew you towards biology?
  I'm fine, but I can't afford it.
  Ok, I SEE (it) that you want to live there.
  Where's that?
  Why don’t you introduce me?
  I think we need to talk about your teaching style. I don't like it, and I think we need to make some changes — right now.
  I never heard about that.
  What did you find?
  I have a full class load and will be heavily involved in community service
  You can also do this.
  Shake it up more.
  Where are you now?
  I can help you with that.
  That's called the abandoned mine, I believe.
  The customs will fill it out.
  No, you didn't.
  God.
  What class do you have left to take?
  There's no way!
  I don't understand why it matters.
  Is it expensive?
  Ubiquitous.
  That's great to hear. Kudos to you.
 OK, I’ll cut it in a shorter style this time around.
  No, not everyone. The guy had a lot of power and didn't take no for an answer. He could do whatever he wanted with everyone looking the other way.
  Not that I'm worry or anything like that, is there anything I should know about the x-ray procedure?
  Oh, a no good person, huh?
  That's ridiculous.
  Still, we need a new guy to get things really going.
  Where is it?
  I'm just glad that I didn't buy one.
  You do not know what they will do to me if you do.
  A clean-up.
  Another option is paying someone to do it for you.
  She is very kind for doing that.
  No, I didn't.
  I was here earlier looking for some glue.
  I am sorry, but I have a previous engagement.
  It is nice, isn't it?
  It's true. I was so pleased with the service. I can't wait to come back here again.
  Yeah, they made us do the downward dog. 
  He doesn't know who he is.
  Ah. Is it for school?
  Yeah, right. 
  What is your name please?
  I'm even willing to leave my family if you want.
  Every trustening is a circle, so this statement is true.
 I have to run some errands later. How about you?
  We can do a sand sculpture.
  It's the perfect location to land and explore.
  What colors do you have?
  What is the meaning of this face?
  But when you grow up, it gives permission to other people to know how old you are.
  I am doing so-so.
  In that case, I would try the transit office which is located at the corner of Main and First street. It is open from 8:30 to 12 Monday thru Friday.
  She said that?
  I have never been to that place.
  I don't know.
  I'm sure everything will work out.
  It's very hot in here, isn't it?
 I love the ocean.
  *facepalm*
  Why not?
  In 1976.
  Then you have to sell yourself some more time.
  Oh, I see. How's James? Is he doing well?
  Me too.
  What team are they playing?
  Do pictures or magazines help you know what styles are in fashion?
  That's good; you're making progress.
  Oh, I didn't realize. Let me go delete it.
  Yes. And what is the problem with the delivery?
 Huh? Of course it is, it's totally orange!
  *Sigh!*
  The Chicken Caesar wrap.
  I ordered after the person before me.
  It's not dangerous. I've tried it and float for a few minutes at the swimming pool.
 
  Sure, here you are, thank you.
  
  My wife loves making Rube Goldberg machines. We were dating at the time, and she made me a birthday card using cranes, pneumatic tubes, wheels, tons of rubber bands, axle bearings, ball bearings, etc.
  You can't get a job.
 Got it!
  No, I'm serious.
  Why did you get out of the car?
  No, as usual they forgot so I had to do it.
 OK, I'm going to find your account.
  At my favorite Chinese restaurant? 
  Firstly because the character of Roy was clearly able to drive his car, but also because there were other characters in the movie who drove cars without obvious difficulties.
  I guess that means I must be a Republican, hmm?
  Too near the air conditioner.
  And I took two out!
  So did I!
  What is your age and date of birth?
  It's very different.
  Probably tobacco with less nicotine. Or maybe not so much tobacco at all.
  No.
  Um, neither. I'll donate my body to science.
  What is the Routing number and Account Number for your savings account?
  Can I have some of your potatoes?
  I can't resist. 
  I don't like them.
  I am so sorry! Today, on the way home from work, I stopped by the restroom on the street. I was so tired that I fell asleep on the toilet.
  Good.
  It's not that, either. 
  You have a fever? 
  Yeah. If it weren't for some nice shade from those trees that person planted, I definitely wouldn't have been able to do this hike.
  Can I help you?
  But does it have all the features you want?
  What class are you going to?
  No way! I don't believe you!
  Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok! Ok
  We always sit close to each other. 
  It wasn't that bad.
  They all seem difficult though.
  Who should I write the recommendation to?
  In that case you should really be careful.
  Do you not speak to customers anymore?
  What is death?
  Well, I live by myself too and I don't have a gun.
  I did. It was good. Can we talk about it later in person?
  We need your passport copy and two photos.
  No, you can find those on other networks; I mean the ones about the local companies.
  I told you in the past.
  Because it's not late.
  No. But he said he'd bring some friends with him.
  Yeah. There's a show on I want to watch.
  Yes, I read it. You left my questions off of it.
 Look in the freezer.
  But I have allergies.
  Yes.
  It's like the Keystone Pipeline of Internet V-Shitstorms. 
  It's delicious.
 
  It's said to be based on true events.
  Can I get a cup of coffee?
  Why wouldn't he?
  That's true, but what about Person3?
  We didn't keep our appointment. 
  Do you already have a membership card?
  The microsegmentation in the bus is not clear.
  I bought mine last week.
  What's wrong?
no reponse
  But, Mom, I'm not dirty.
  Is it pretty heavy?
  How did you know that?
 ・・・It is not a vending machine.
  Sure.
  Why not? 
  Second, he didn't do much.
  Do you have a pencil sharpener?
  You should really get to bed earlier.
  I have a Nissan Tiida.
Person2:
  They will try to give you an extra $10,000 so that you don't do it.
  I bought a laptop.
  I thought this was a warning.
  No. It's because there's nothing to think about.
  You should go there more often.
  I guess I'll have to get it at a Korean market.
  What's the difference? 
  I'm sorry, the apartment is already taken.
  You will have to figure it out.
  It's nothing great.
  University of Santa Clara? What were they doing at the store?
  I will show you!
  I teach GRADE 8.
  You said that you were robbed.
  About two years. It's a nice neighborhood.
 
  Cause my dad is a jerk
  I see.
  No, but I am looking forward to wearing it to work tomorrow!
  Oh great. Maybe I’ll find a Christmas present for Mom there.
  How?
  That stinks.
  I'll love it.
  Totally agreed!
  He thought it might be a problem with the telephone.
  Wow, that's amazing.
  No problem.
  To get to it, you have to go down the hallway between the front door and the kitchen.
  Good, because my job made me depressed and run out of the house with nothing but my underwear. I've been sleeping on the streets.
  The one on the shirt?
  That’s great. I am happy for you. What is it?
  Use the one that is near your house!
  We need $4600.
  I saw that at the Olympics. 
  True. But this is not the best way to find out who's the best person to act in that role. You need to bet on Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt to act in that movie, not to see whether they will fall during the shooting.
  Oh. That’s interesting. So what happened to them?
 Why? It seems like a nice place.
  Why?
  That's because the waiting room was too crowded.
  Where are you going?
  Yes, they have locks on them.
 
  Ready for the big switch.
  No. It is for club members only.
  OK. How about a tuna casserole?
  That's a great idea.
  It's a cat.
  No, but it is sung in a style that is formal and very difficult to understand.
  Log into your online banking, and go to find/past transactions. You search for the transaction you are looking for, select it & then edit the amount - editing it to say $0.00.
  But you don't have a class!'?' 
  He must be so lucky to have her.
 . Have you progressed in the company?
  Oh, this is good. 
  Probably snowing.
  We have a 7-Day Free trial on first time users. After you complete the trial period, do let me know if you would like to purchase a card.
  Sarah, can you get the files I need for the presentation?
  Why can’t I take the rock then, mommy?
  What do you mean?
  Oh, okay. Where is the proxy located?
  Oh, can you go to a buffet when you are on a diet?
  I agree. But how can I see what happened a decade ago with my own eyes?
  I can certainly help you with that, Doug. We are experts in the field of real estate needs.
  But they weren't a part of the Social Social Sports Club.
  Five pencils.
  I have a test in Chinese tomorrow.
 That's dumb.
  It's not about Judy, it's about Mary.
  What do you not understand?
  Yes, they would be standing/parking in parking numbers 21-28.
  Have you applied for one before?
  If you want them to see your drawings, why don't you send them an email or something.
  I can smell odours, but not very well.
  What are you talking about?
  Are we going to vote?
  Yes, I know.
  Well, you can still hear peoples chips land.
  Oh, that's bad.
  Oh, this is not the time for playing around.
  They sure are.
  It wasn't for sale.
  Ask away.
  Hey, I've watched the show.
  NO!
 
  Of course I do. I was going slightly above the speed limit, and I almost hit the car in front of me when I stopped.
  I can't help, but I think I know someone who might.
  What do you like about Italy?
  What should we do about the elevator?
  What makes it ache? Is it due to something you have been doing lately?
  I don't think that I can help you with that.
  Stomach bacteria.
  Is Saturday a work day for you?
  I love chocolate.
  It's bad manners!
  You can say that again.
  You can never have too many clothes.
  No, you get them with cash or credit.
  We can always compare the prices of a few different real estate agencies if we're going to rent a house from one of them.
  I noticed you are drinking coffee daily. Person2(a):  _____ Person2(b): "Yes , I drink it everyday."
  You should have thought about that before.
  What's his name?
 I really am not sure.
  I'm going to order a burger to go.
  I'm sure it will be, but that's not the point.
  It's delicious. What do you think it tastes like?
  I'm sick.
  David! Go clean your room right now!
  The card is like a credit.
  Of course it matters. You can't call me now!
  Oh, that can explain it.
  She was complaining about very severe pain in her left arm.
  I expect she will send her message tonight.
  I want some.
  That's easy to find. As for trade schools, options vary by locale.
  Let's go to the Hibachi buffet.
  's song.
  Why not just call him?
  Where did you break it?
  No... maybe I should.
  I'm sorry to hear.
  I am going on vacation.
  Are you sure?
  Sorry again. I overslept because I was late for work yesterday.
  It's not the UN, it is UNICEF. There is a difference you know.
  I suppose so.
  Huh?
  To the state or to the country?
  We can make money off of this!
  (thinking: This person must like to read.)
  Did you hurt yourself?
  Well, maybe I should have known that.
  It's so nice of you to give it to me so quickly.
  Yes, it's called Italian.
  Wouldn't you rather be a writer or teacher?
  No, it closes at 2 a.m.
  I did not see a stop sign.
  First off, I'd like to say that this class has been amazing.
  Thunder sticks the ground.
  Oh why Texas?
  You do?
  I hear a sound.
 Oh, yeah. Okay. 
  What?
  That's an additional $2.50.
  Why didn't you back up your contacts?
  Her name is Mayu. She works at a coffee shop near my house. We have been hooking up for a while now.
  That can't be right.
  %s?
  I know.
  It does!
  But you do fine when you talk in class.
  I am from Boston, Massachusetts.
  Good thing he told me that.
  Why don't you just leave it?
  From the store.
  I think I'll have my steak medium-well.
  Music.
  Was it a private plane?
  You should put some more gear on it. Where are your glasses?
  It's bright orange.
  But the tissues in the bathroom do not work for me.
  Aren't you going to negotiate? I am a broke student, meaning I have no money or resources to hire a lawyer.
 I'm sorry. You are 512879346 John.
  Exactly. Your new neighborhood is beautiful.
  You can always access my computer.
  The grass is growing very quickly now, because it's spring now.
  It leaves every ten minutes.
  Ok, what kind of questions? 
  Well, it's against the law to take any kind of drugs while at cruising altitude.
  I don’t know.
  I know.
  I have five dollars.
  Yes. He hasn't played since 2013.
  I'm jealous...
  In the DEPUTY GOVERNOR's district.
  Do you know where the original is right now?
  What's to check?
  It will have bad consequences.
  Could they do that?
  Person2, why are you avoiding the question?
  Oh, then what is it?
  Go ahead.
  Why don't you make him a present? 
  No, thank you. I'm sure that we'll be able to complete business today. However, if you are unable to show identification at this time, fill out this form. Please sign next to your name under penalty of law.
  The weather will be good tomorrow.
  I'm in a really deep sleep right now. So I don't think I'll hear the phone call.
  Do you want condiments?
  I did! Did you?
  But why do you want to cut it down?
  Yeah, but it's faster.
  Nice to meet you, Lisa. You are?
  Not quite. It's more like $2,000 after taxes...etc...etc...
  I don't know. I'm stuffed after eating so much in the exam period...
  The cost is one dollar and fifty cents.
  I don't want one. I can read perfectly fine.
  So, could you tell me why you love the snow?
  Oh, thank you. 
  But you don't. I've seen you there sometimes, and you never even look out the window.
  I think it exists because...
  I washed the dishes.
  I'm sorry to hear that , but in winter, it's two in one.
  Teach me a card game.
  Are the questions difficult?
  Why?
  Thank you.
  Pretty obvious, huh? Looking for those extra plastic cups.
  Well, I'd better be going.
  Don't know where it is? 
  But... But... But...
  Because it's three in the morning.
 Hahaha, I told you so.
  No, I'm not kidding.
  I'm sleepy.
  I know just what I want to eat.
  I just took a walk in my neighborhood. I noticed that it had become easier lately and that people were smiling more and waving to me. People seem to be friendlier recently. I think my exercise program was working.
  About three years now.
 That's sad to hear. Person2: I know.
  There is nothing else, right ?
  Mostly just the music and the dancing. I'm not much of a party-er.
  No, it doesn't have any.
  I need two shoulders from two pigs.
  Maybe fifteen.
  I haven’t found a lot of sporting goods that I like.
  What was the man dreaming of?
  I wonder who is going to win?
  I'm not eating them anytime soon.
 What I like most about it is that you can use it to construct a sentence.
  Or I think kids are taking drugs or breaking other peoples property.
  It's chilly outside, too.
  Remember to always ask for a receipt in a store.
  But it is a nice way to keep in touch with your friends.
  Thank you. About my loan...
  How can you say that? You are great!
  Hold on - do you mean that my wheels are in a line, or my wheels are in alignment?
  Why didn't you tell me that before?
  But isn't there a used book sale this weekend? I want to go there.
  That's terrible. Person2:   I know. Person1:  Maybe she can't handle commitment?
  What?
  It doesn't matter.
  This is not a size eight. 
  They walk in the shadows.
  So, what happen?
  How did he look?
  I know the woman who made them.
  We've been living here for over a year
  Why?
  Through a friend.
  I don't know. I think I just want to go home.
  It is considered in good manners to poke a hole in a piece of food and eat it with a spoon!
  I can bring it home with me.
  Too bad.
What is the purpose of taking time away from children?
  Which kind of car problems? 
 
  I did. But I could not find anything good so I did not buy anything.
  Yes, it is coming now.
  I'm not a nurse.
  I do not like it. 
  Allentown.
  I was in the library when I saw this scene. The girl sitting beside me was reading something, and she leaves for a second. When she comes back, her book is not the same one she was originally reading!
  You can get it from changing your contact lenses, but you can't get it from touching them.
  I'd like a glass of ice water, then.
  Oh, you didn't endorse the check. It's the part where you sign your name. The check has your name on it. Three things happen when you endorse the check: (1) it's cleared by the bank, (2) you get to keep the check, and (3) you take ownership of the funds. The check belongs to you now.
  That is why they are recruiting.
  Is that all? Mine is over 20 years old.
  Hmm ... me too. That's cool.
  Yes, I am.
  I know! We could use the dog's bucket.
 6. no way
  That's what you said last time.
  It is a fake website, ching33.com.
  Hello again.
  Really? 
  Then click the search icon, type tumbler in it, download the first app that appears by Tumblr, and then click 'install'.
  No way! Unbelievable?
  Why not.
  Oh, that's him! He's the first on the left.
  What is this for?
  You can't be serious, you expect me to believe an African American would do the same thing a white American would?
  I don't get it.
  I am afraid that.
  How much money do you have?
  Why are you pulling me off?
  The park by the garage?
  I think I want to eat some Chinese food today.
  It's not so bright.
  Thank you. Here is the invoice.
  Did you know who to vote for?
  You didn't have to worry this much.
  I do?
  Are you sure? I don't see anyone there.
  This park is beautiful.
  No, I did not. My lips are sealed, signed and delivered.
  I listen to Korean songs and Korean drama.
  Me, too.
  Do you like men?
  My next friend is Abigail.
  How much?
  It is a hassle, but if you don’t do it, you can’t wear your clothes.
  Why aren't you exercising like I told you last time?
 I went yesterday.
  I'm so nervous because I have to take six midterms to pass the class!
  You should have had to fill out some forms before your consultation with him, can I see them? 
  No, it's an RPG.
  But if you drink too much of it, it will be bad for you.
  I am not sure.
  Ah. Have fun with that, guys! 
  At least ten more minutes.
  Wait, I think I may have your pamphlet. Let me go look...
  Are you sure it wasn't a siren?
  Major Lazer and Grouplove. I listen to them often.
  The bed? What do you mean?
  You can eat a TV dinner without heating it up.
  I'm sure it wasn't easy finding one.
  But I cannot imagine what this shape looks like!
  What do you have?
  I guess you're right.
  Why were you working late?
  Do you like eating there?
  Can I speak with your supervisor?
  I never thought you would want to take a psychology class. 
  What's the matter with this one?
  You can't believe what people say to you.
  It really hurts.
  I see. So you are new to this system.
  Yes, the remote. 
 
  Why?
  No, there is no station.
  Don't worry. I'll be able to help you. Just let me ask you some questions. First of all, what country are you in?
  Any pick-up is good, as long as I get to the terminal before the flight boards.
  I teach mathematics.
  What happened to that pair?
  Oh, no! I'm very sorry to hear that. Let me contact the manager on duty. Keep your shirt on! Sit tight!
  Do you have any discounts?
  I made it over the course of a few days.
  Almost like searching cars at the airport.
  I don't know.
  Let me see. If you do not leave until five in the morning, then it will be difficult.
  Thanks. Are things going well for you?
  You're right! It is. Why did the person put it on the shelf?
    I am not sure if I will win the lottery.
  I know. I wish I didn't have pimples.
  I watched it at the film festival.
  Isn't it easier to check the shoes that you choose?
  Are you rich?
  What does he care and why is he there in the hospital?
  Here is the team. Let's talk about your furniture.
  I know, but he is very sick now.
  You better clean it or you won't get to go to your friends house.
  Why?
  He thinks I'm not eating enough.
 I understand, I'll give you the address of the library. It's very close by.
  Color copies can be made in the business center on the second floor.
 I love the one that I did at Camp Potowmaquadeh.
  No, just once or twice when he needed help with his computer.
  But hasn't the red one already turned green?
  Not now, I'm going to make a salad.
  And now those poor families don't even have a home.
  Ok. What would you like to do?
  Yes, sir. I have been busy with work.
 
  Oh, I see.
  You do not understand how hard it is to come up with practical applications for theoretical concepts.
  Well I have never seen or heard them practicing so it doesn't count.
  Ugh what?
  I like this restaurant because they give you free bread.
  That whom doesn't want Obama as President.
  How did it die?
  What do you think about the new player, Player2?
  Nobody likes to wait for a DVD to come out.
  I have to finish this report.
  It's so good!
  No Problem. Next time I'll explain to you.
  I know which buses to get on because i've done the walking around 
  Can you watch a mechanic fix our car?
  Because there is a serial I like.
  Sure, I don’t have any plans. 
  I thought you wanted to stay on the west coast.
  I think that sounds fine.
  It was three thousand dollars.
  I go to TJC.
  I am glad that you had a nice time. I totally enjoyed myself too.
  It's too loud.
 Why didn't you watch TV then?
  Oh dear, I have to go by that time.
  Awesome. Thank you!
  I only meant that there were no cars in front of me.
  I had to blow right next to the phone.
  You can watch TV at my place. I live closer.
  I know.
  He is to speak in public tomorrow.
  You have a heck of a lot of stuff stashed in the garage.
  Yea. I want to run the 10K next semester. What distance are you training for?
  This really confuses me.
  That’s what I’m talking about.
  Hey... if a doctor helps a guy hit home runs, why not?
  I saw. It's looking good. We should be able to move in soon.
  Pasadena is a city, a district, and a military base all in Southern California.
  No.
  Yes.
  What's the card for? Does it have a bonus?
  What did you buy?
  I don't 'want' to do it right. It's a game, for entertainment.
  No. I would love to if I could...
  I told you so. Why did you have to go? Now you are left with nothing.
  Well, why not?
 Why didn't you file a complaint to the authority?
  I don't have a Facebook account.
  There are of course buses. I take the metro sometimes.
  The police can't help.
  Each bus has a specific stop it goes to.
  I've been trying to subscribe, but it's not working.
 Yes, when you come in, there is a parking lot to the right. There are lots of spots.
  We've seen plenty. There's the group that lives in the clear stream water, and there's another group that lives in the muddy pond.
  Not for me, but I do like how it looks. It looks like a flower(花), like the Sakura flower(桜).
  What do you mean by that?
  I see, so where are you buying it?
  I'm not sure if it is a great fit for me, but I think I should really think about it a little more.
  Good. Have fun.
  Exactly, it helps to get a leg up on the competition.
  Did you see what was under your shoes?
  Is this about my sweater? 
  Please relax. I'll send a few of our technicians to your place right away. Also a few housekeeping will assist you on the matter.
  From when to when does it go?
  Perfect.
  I used to write poetry
  Very good, thank you. May I have your street address, please?
  Oh, ok. I wish him good luck with his daughter.
  That's mean, I wouldn't like getting that stuff in my eyes.
  Shut up, I don't want to hear that crime shit right now.
  Where are they?
  Are you telling the truth?
 Late.
  I measured all the frames and wrote down the measurements. So when I buy the picture frame holders, I can get the ones with the correct measurement.
  No, not too small.
  It doesn't matter as long as you're okay!
?
  Isn't there a way to make you feel safer without owning a gun?
  Come on, I won't care.
  Good luck with that.
  I hate bass.
 
  Collage is when they break your soul, when you're in college you put it back together
  I’m afraid that there would be an unexpected guest in the future and also, I’m afraid of robbers.
  Yes.
  Well, I didn’t.
  Patricia and I have been together for five years. But, she does not belong to my family so she is not my wife.
  Oh, that's great! What kind is it?
  Japan?
  I know, I know.
  Who did it?
  Thanks for voting for me!
  I'm from New York.
  Why?
  There were no measures on the ballot to improve our health care.
  I hear the weather is supposed to be good.
  borrow money
  There are so many people I know nothing about.
  How old were you in 1945?
  We never charge any fees.
  Probably. I mean they store all my info in the cloud so knowing it's there is like knowing they're spying on me. They probably see everything I do and everything I said before.
  It's the extra weight gained by college students during their first year of school. It's usually around 15 lbs.
  I actually just got an email from some group that called me a "n--ger f--ker" for being a supporter of yours.
  That's fine. I just had to get your attention.
  It's this one.
  This is a fast food, isn't it?
  It also made me teary to see the family members celebrating the newlywed couple.
  "Open your window and see if it's still raining outside."
  I have a Mazda 323.
  No you are not. Person2:  Person1 was driving Person2’s car, so Person2 used person1’s name.
  Please have a seat.
  Well go clean it!!
  Is that bad?
  Does this start after you went out to the cold weather?
  Oops! I forgot to mention it.
  Ouch! How much did something end up costing you?
  Not bad. They love me and I love them too.
  I had a hard time finding a parking place.
  He was angry.
  If we run, we can get to my house before they get here.
  It's ok. I see that you're nervous
  Of course, many people believe that.
  What happened to the student in the front of your class?
  So we have a bus transfer.
  It's really sweet.
  That's a very good book. I've read it before. I'll tell you what happens then you can decide whether or not 
  I would like a green salad and some rice, please.
  Do you like chocolate cake?
  My computer is still in repair.
  I don't really want to talk about that.
  Hmmm... how 'bout this one?
  It is art.
  That sounds nice. Why don’t we stop?
  
  What? You had me send you a check and that's how you pay the mortgage!
  You are addicted to coffee!
  Well, I'm going to the store now. Do you want anything?
  Yes, I really do.
  They're just trying to survive, you should be more understanding.
  I think being a skunk is still better.
  But I don't want to.
  Suppose we try that new restaurant down the street first.
  Excuse me?
  Isn't there an easier route to take up the hill?
no reponse
  Can we edit it?
  Of all time?
  How old is he?
  I am fine.
  Only two.
  Are you using inappropriate attire? Are you sure that you are dressing appropriately for an interview? 
  Oh. Did you take care of it?
  But I do not like brussel sprouts.
  Are you sure?
  Well maybe I could test it out while volunteering at Yosemite.
  But I have a blue shirt on.
  I see the name "Student 14" on the board, but I'm not sure of which person you're referring to. Could you please tell me their first and last names.
  Even the most secure network is not working?
  No, why should I?
  I prefer action movies over romance.
  Where did you go?
  I don't want to get sick from something that I can't see.
  I always feel worn out when I sit in the chair.
  It is.
  I wanted to do that.
  I was wondering if you could give me any advice for looking for a job.
  I want to read that article.
  I'm going to be studying hard today.
  Well, we just got our first delivery and we're quite disappointed with the result.
  Why's that?
no reponse
  I don’t see the joke.
  Last year I had to share my phone.
  I am from Singapore.
  
  It's due tomorrow.
  It's a house salad.
  Mmm pizza.
  Let me see your phone again.
  I know.
  Person2 nodded Yes.
  She's bleeding badly.
  Satan should have never tempted Adam and Eve.
  I only saw the tip of your bill.
  I've had enough, and am tired.
  I know the Spanish word for school.
  Nothing. I changed the light bulb.
  Oh, I don’t know.
  This one has three bedrooms!
  Johnson.
  He was a progressive candidate.
  I'll eat whatever's on the menu
  Why would I use any picture?
  You should just try it! Often times when you buy something, you can’t actually picture how well it works. But when you have the product in your hands, you are happy with what you bought.
 Living the life of a celebrity is more exciting than working.
  Jonathan bought Bob one for his birthday.
  So?
  That's not something to be excited about.
  She would only eat macaroni and cheese!
  Your hands should be at 10 and 2, not 8 and 4.
 
  I'll talk to support about that for you.
  16 is awesome!
 We've never talked like this before. I was starting to get annoyed.
  Thanks. It's fine, though.
  There's a difference?!
  Go check the phone line and modem status.
  It will happen by the end of this year.
  I expect so. I'll talk to Mr. Johnson in detail about it in my office this afternoon.
  Yeah, I'm thinking about doing the same thing.
  You broke your leg?
  I had a wank this morning on the stairs.
  Yes, he does.
  Sorry about that, what if I make it like this?
  Yeah, but it's really hard...I can't shoot anyone, but I can die instantly!
  That won't be necessary, thank you. Can you recommend the house specialty?
  
  I thought you were sure.
  I like the rides and the good food.
  That's weird.
  Check the balance first.
  I heard that the season finale is happening from a friend.
  We could go longer.
  Which school do you want to get into?
  No.
  I cannot find you one since I am not in that line of work.
  Please tell me, I'll be able to handle it. 
  Which I did.
  Well, the best thing to do would be to compare prices on each service. I mean, what goes into the price has to be the same. Like, the car rental company has to pick us up at the airport. The hotel still has to spend $50 for breakfast hardly anything should differ so how should the prices look so different?
  Where are you traveling to?
  A little.
  Darn it.
  Are you liking rice, noodles or pasta?
 I will do so as soon as possible.
  It is a computer game on Facebook.
  Sure, he has experience in the restaurant business, but he's also been in jail three times already.
  How did you know it was my truck?
  You have the option to pay back what you took so you can have credit. But if you pay your card off before your next statement period, the difference won't show up there either.
  No one will see us there.
  April 12
  He said he'd come over in the morning.
  Someone should implement it.
  She's the tall one crouching down, right?Ya I figured.
 The car next to mine was parked really close to my car, I tried to pull out of my spot and hit their car.
  When were you looking to look at it?
  No, but I think it's too late for me to take one now.
  It does count. I have exercised no restraint.
  Not really.
  Where were you? I was at the Town Hall!
  Were you a painter?
  An hour or so, I guess.
  I'll help you with that.
  What are you going to do?
  
  No, I just love the smell of the salt-water air.
  I see.
 Hugo Chávez is a dictator, who is likely to go after the opposition.
 
  Of course not. I use it every day.
  I'm glad that you invited me over.
  What?
  Why not?
  A basketball hoop.
  I see a red one that looks just fine.
  It shouldn't take more than 10 minutes.
  I didn't know you were looking for a job.
  This museum has many beautiful statues.
  I didn't mean any offence.
  Aha! So you've changed.
 Why not?
  
  I have to walk the beagle.
  John is not my son and I am not married.
  Your lawn looks nice, but my riding lawn mower keeps it nice.
  No, I haven’t worn it yet.
  How much will you get?
  I meowed at it and it didn't react.
  Why? I'm fine here.
  Same here. But I certainly don't have time to take an extra class.
  How many did you apply to?
  Yes. It's on every afternoon
  I hope they fit.
  It’s a card where I can collect points when I drink water.
  (to self) Don't want to fail, don't want to fail,...
  No.
  I thought they played on a neutral field.
  The chair is too low.
  I can sure try.
  What does it accomplish?
  Never. 
  She's speechless and slumped over.
  I'm disappointed. It's not like you to be mean to strangers.
  If you don't need many checks, there's no need for you to open the account.
  It sounds like you're not feeling well.
  I prefer to stand, sir.
  Really? High how?
  I'm sorry. I wasn't paying attention. Well, I can understand.Yes, of course. That's perfectly acceptable. I'll get you the check.
  No, not really. I like to show off.
  But... but... They can't do that!
  Do you know when the film starts?
  Why do you think that is?
  Oh. I totally forgot about it.
 I mean after you find the button.
  Me.
  It's time we go spend some money on some souvenirs.
  See.
  Why?
 
  Why, yes it is!
  Okay. What is our goal?
  When they watch me it feels like I'm being watched.
  So, it should be an A.
  We have freedom. God is there for us if we want to believe in him.
  OK, this is your boarding pass. You may proceed down that hallway there (points), and come out on the other side.
  I heard that he takes vitamins every day.
  As in, there were more people who voted for that candidate than the total number of people there?!
  Maybe if we don’t give it any food, they'll go elsewhere.
  So?
  My hands and face and clothes and ... and ... and ... and ... and ... and ... and ... and ...
  How was your first day at work?
  I worked for four hours today.
  I'm driving to Boise, Idaho.
 The ball he drove at the eighteenth must have been hit even harder than yesterday's.
  Please give me your name please.
  You don't say!
  They shouldn't have built that huge building down there.
  They're just trying to put me down.
  I don't know.
  $1.86 for your order, please.
  If they are essential, why wasn't I told about them?
  It sounds great.
  Yeah me too.
  I don't feel like I've achieved anything in my life.
  I like to stay at home. There is no meaning to my life anymore. I am not myself.
  That's so boring...
  
  Common language should not stop people.
  You should not unplug the phone.
  People eat insects in some Asian countries.
  Yes, I have choir activities.
  So you can eat the buffet you want from the food they offer?
  No.
  Don't worry! I'll help you. If anything, please let me know what I can do for you.
  Actually, he also has six years of experience on the city council.
  Tumblr. That name is great! Cool, I'm going to sign up right now.
  We do fight, but not much.
  Don't worry, I will find one.
  I told you not to call me at 5:30.
  Why did you ask me to bring this book to you?
  There's this one waiter with curly hair.
  When was you robbed?
  She seems unable to speak any more. And she says she feels numbness in her left hand, right arm and left leg.
  I see your point. I'm just getting tired of waiting.
  [anger in voice]   [angrily] I paid my fucking meter, I can park here! 
  Please, just come in.
  Oh, where are you?
  It is $28.
  Which "version" are you running?
  the #3.
  How can I listen?
  How come?
  No, you do not; they’re non-prescription (over-the-counter).
  They are for Sally.
  Give my regards to your parents.
  Are you in the bus?
  Well, they look like bubbles to me.
  City officials have been doing a very good job.
 You must have a lot of relatives.
  And what do you mean use the database? What application will you use, and how do you plan to interact with it?
 I like to swing a bat.
  You don't have a drawing blog or even a twitter account?
  Print media is referred to as dead.
  You've seen it that much ?! That's crazy. Hey how many dates did you go on with Kristen Stewart?
  We need a copy of your driver’s license and a bill.
  We see your mother everyday.
  The news says it happened the day before yesterday.
  I don't want it on the floor!
  A committee? 
  I see. You seem more familiar than usual
  Yes. 
  That's not true. 
  Thank you. How many in the party?
  No, I don't think it's a good idea. It's too close to the kitchen door and it's right under that lamp. It would get dirty easily.
  Well, a friend gave me a loaf of bread.
  I don’t like the wine and the cellar is really expensive!
  I bought a black sweater, that's all.
  It is about 14 minutes.
  I was just looking at my face.
  Well, my office building is right up the hill from City Hall.
  Rough.
  Shipment is moving along schedule.
  I don't have time to exercise today.
  It doesn't make sense to me either.
  Well, I guess we should cover it and get out of here.
  What do you call this?
  Ah.
  You like them?
  That would have been awful.
  It's hard to see what saving the school money will mean in practice. I need more information.
  The $20 deposit I gave you on the $120 invoice.
  Have you had any experience on boats and ships and such?
  Teacher said "Every student should bring their student ID on the first class."
  It matters to the DMV. DMV policy is to not report successful completion of traffic school unless court mandated. 
  Yeah but they're not really random.
  That’s bullshit.
  You work so many hours?
  Me neither, but I don't know...
  But why?
  How can you say that? You weren't even there.
  Let's sit him up, and get him to take some antacids.
  Okay, don’t you realize that I'm watching that documentary right now?
  I don't like you.
  Your account will show your real birth date.
  Singapore is Singapore.
  You are lying.
  It got stuck again.
  Oh yeah! Person2: Tell me, tell me.
  It won't show the amount of the ticket.
  I do not mean to alarm you, but I just calculated the numbers. According to the rule of 70, if we continue with our current 5% growth rate, how long until we have a million dollars?
  Sure, go right ahead.
  But we completed everything?
  Look, I was fine before we started talking.
  
  Really? I'm shocked.
  Nothing seems to have come in. Have you been able to find one?
  I don't know. How is the weather in Colorado in the summer?
   I mean, I know what it's made with, but is there something special
  Well, you could go to the library where I work/I went to the library across the street from my house.
  You can't be serious.
  It's too dirty to clean.
  Yes, usually Italian because it is the language of operas.
  Raise the window.
  Well, I’m worried about her.
  I like that idea. I like to look at the sea. It's beautiful.
  
  An alternative to the health care reform created by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), known informally as "Obamacare."
  I see your point. <---Passive understanding.
  It's unbearable! Can you just clean it?!
  What do you mean by not having it right now?!
  I don't care!!
  This shuttle bus will take you to the rental car location.
  Both are harmful.
  It's so great to be with you.
  Is an online account the same thing as social network?
  Make it look cute.
  No, not a checking account.
  Let's go get dinner.
  We go door-to-door and ask people to vote and give us an update on what voters care about. We knock on doors, listen to voters and talk to them so we know what we must offer in the next election.
 What if she can't eat gluten?
  Then let’s stop!
  Hmm … I think you may need to type more than just that.
  My Aunt Edna is in town, she wants to go to the park too.
  She is my pillow.
  
  You don't sound happy.
  It's not very clean.
 
  Are you alright? What happened?
  We are over tipping.
  I don't know. 
  Where did you leave your umbrella?
  Nope, it’s because fishing is so complicated.
  What is the food you want to buy?
  Why did you warn her?
  Oh, a pound of imported chocolates. That's a good deal.
  We have monthly,3 month and 12 month membership plans.
  What’s your favorite food?
  Therefore, you stole her car?
  You assume a lot! What proof do you have?
  My order number is 12345.
  [In a more insistent tone.] I know that. How did you do it?
  You did?
 That's a brilliant idea. I will ask them when they call in my wakeup call.
  Yes, I could hardly do the downward facing dog because my back would hurt.
  And what else?
  No, I didn't.
  Well, we each have a mini-bar in the back of our seats. You can order yourself a drink and your flight attendant can bring it to you.
  Are you sad person?
  Please tell me your name.
  It's made in a factory.
  Oops. My bad.
  .
  Why not?
  Yeah, also some erasers.
  It's still pretty hot, but I hear there's a chance of thunderstorms.
  That's right. 
  They just don't give a shit about their customers.
  Nothing ever lasts these days.
  Yes, they have several kinds. The student pass costs $26.50. The adult pass varies depending on the number of days it covers. If three days, it costs $28.50; if five days, it costs $30; if seven days, it costs $31.
  You mean switch seasons?
  That punch-out was probably the most boring punch-out in history.
  It was supposed to be 70.
  That's nice. How long ago was that?
  They could not take their belongings because the fire was very fast and surprise to everyone.
  Does it pull everything downward?
  Not at all. I think it is very good.
  I want to do something which is more about helping human beings. So this isn't really interesting to me.
  
  I’d like to ask this for the first time.
  It's yellow!
  Do you really want to know?
  Will it be a small or a large business?
  What is stopping you?
  Yes. The one by the sign is a recycling bin.
  I don't like helmets. Why do we need one?
  What is your username? 
  Why did you shake it?
  Sure, what's the number?
  No, many of the houses don't.
  30 minutes.
  How do you go to school?
  I wish your father had more money.
  The ball has the slogan "Breast cancer awareness".
  Another pebble. It was the last one. 
  I don't want to go out with friends anymore
  It's just entertainment.
  I was wondering the same thing myself, so I need to make a decision on my route.
  Yes! It would be called Sibling Island! Old people who are Dinker. Maybe they get too old to take care of themselves anymore.
  Let's try the key again.
  That's strange.
  What is a long time ago?
   No, I didn't.
  I know that.
  How could that be? He had a snowball in his hand.
  Now, if another player hits a bad shot, you will say to yourself, "Oh! That must have been a good break!"
  I think you are nice, but...
  Well, necessarily. I just thought you may need a break and I was hoping to take one with you. Maybe we could trade you driving and I would like to take it. Or, if you would prefer, we can split the cost and take it together.
  It hardly needs mowing!
  So, you're telling me that you got a ticket for running a red light the day after I said that it is not a problem?
  Yes, it’s very rewarding.
  I'm sure it's fine.
  There was no door.
  You know, Mr. Fodor (Person1 sitting next to them both in the same class), may I go to the bathroom?
  I went to the gym!
  No, my child seems to be having breathing problems. Can you help us?
  I know.
 : Wow! 
  At what time did you see that bus?
  I think it's on the other side of the island. This island is sooo big...
  Two teas, one black and the other with lemon and sugar.
  OK, I'll sell it to you for $45.
  Do you love your baby?
  You can't tell me to change my speed.
  No it's a racing game.
  Since you're so young and yet so good-looking, I had assumed you were a regular. Do tell me your secret.
  She gives bright smiles and gives good advice. 
  I can't.
  Well then, this is the same thing.
  [In a Belligerent Tone of Voice] Meatloaf is disgusting.
 You mean a 和英辞典 (Wa-eigo-jiten; "Japanese-English Dictionary"), right?
   No, the legal advice centre is open from 10 to 12 pm.
  What were you doing last night?
  The cat wants feeding.
  Oh, don't you know the saying, "Be yourself"?
  They should be treated the way they want to be treated.
  What should be posted on the frame of the car for traffic safety?
 Oh, man, I love pizza! Person2: Great, let's get going!
  Well, that's probably what it is.
  What membership level would you like?
  The doctor said you have to wait for the cast to heal.
  No, I was in a different mood then.
  Yes, there are a few places where several buses will stop.
  Depends on where I’m going to eat.
 What equipment is in use?
  
  How about that one?
  He's an anti-Semite.
  No, we'll make it better. We'll remodel the kitchen and master bathroom and broaden the living area and spread new carpet and paint and upgrade and and and---.
  No, we went for coffee and pizza.
  A little too much of what?
  She graduated!
  We got divorced three years ago.
  You know what I mean.
  I see. So you do not want to have a blood test now?
  Don't be silly.
  Does she hate the color yellow?
  All I'm saying is that I want you to have the best!
  It is not expensive.
  It sure is simple. I wish some of this would be passed on to traffic officers, that way they could try some variations. This would result in more tickets being issued.
  The parking facility for this area has no attendants. You do not need to buy a ticket or display a receipt.
  Good. I've just made you an offer that you have until 10 am, tomorrow to accept or refuse.
  How does this thing work?
  I bought it for my mother.
  What don't you understand?
  Yes, I know it is hot. 
  It's not raining.
  What's this?
  What? I feel fine! I don't want to go!
  I'm telling you there's nothing.
  But I didn't even get to say why.
  選手全員が予約をしていた。
  Oh, okay. How about if you say, "Life can be cruel sometimes."
  I don't like the environment at work, I get stressed out.
  Wow, if you don't know, that may be the reason you don't have much money.
  I got him a gift card. He can work it out himself.
  Did you happen to see anything suspicious yesterday?
  The Metro is going east.
  Well, that's true.
  I'm going to take a wild guess here, but I think you might want an answer.
  Exactly, that's why I'm asking.
  Can't I just sue the people involved in the accident?
  In a box.
  Steve. 
  You need a little bit of exercise for your body.
 We all go there and edit our personal statements.
  I said stop.
  Maybe they should change their name to Public Broken-record System.
  That's true..
  What is your date of birth? 
  Okay, I hear you. Let's go over the factors that set an asking price for a home.
 Oh yeah? I never flew before.
  Yeah, I know. I'm a little scared.
  Stop talking and run.
  I like to play games and watch TV.
  I'll see you later.
  How far did you go?
  I don't really like it.
  What was the result?
  Well, if teachers didn't like to give out Bs, then it'd be a 92 or a 90. If they wanted their students to fail, it would be an 80.
  I'm not interested."
  Oh, that husband? Sure do. For the money.
  What do you mean?
  Great. I want to get moving.
  Only pistols?
   I'd better hurry or I'll be late.
  If you're a basic checking account holder, two of the kinds of fees that we charge are monthly service fees and fees for writing checks.
  How many are there?
  You can do it, you know.
  That's not good to hear. Anything else I can help you with?
  It's a "golf thing".
  How long did it take you to get it?
  Why should I look outside?
  No. That's your new nickname.
  Why didn't you set an alarm on your phone?
  My name is Henry Smith. And your room number, please?
  You hid a key in OUR house?
  Ok.
  I am sorry. We are unable to make changes at this time.
  You should.
  Who?
  Where is she?
  Can you get them back?
  Yes, I read it.
  Why do you think he thought that?
  Hey, there's the bus! We can finally go home.
  I was making a copy. What did you conclude?
  Sure
  So?
  But, I'm not fluent at all.
  I like this!
  A free breakfast?
  Awesome! I can sign up for an American Sign Language class.
  Each day.
  Well,
  She said I was spending too much time on it, now I have to pay her for my phone by working
  
  I am someone who always goes to sleep at 8:00 p.m.
  Is it harmful? 
  It just kind of happens without thinking.
 Okay.
  Okay!
  Oh, now he's done it.
  My girlfriend, _______________________________.
  What kind of chocolate?
  I heard it was because of the budget cuts.
  That long? I have been working here for 2 years.
  No, there is nothing wrong with it. 
  Oh, really? 
  It is the first time I saw you.
  Well?
  You know, I really like her.
  You rephrase.
  I forgot to pay. I’m really sorry.
  Uh-huh.
  A triathlon? You must practice a lot! Person2:   No, not really.
  Ah, I understand. What size scarf are you looking for?
   How would you like to proceed? 
  OK, grab a pencil and paper and we'll try and figure this out!
  I'm going too.
  don't stand out at all
  ...I didn't say anything yet.
  Not very useful if Person1 doesn't know what the language relationship is between them and Person2 (e.g. is it a second language, dialect of Person2's language, etc.)
 I don't know.
  I'm feeling kind of nervous.
  Because of his sense of humour.
  Oh I'll listen to them what can they say? 
  What is the last one on the paper?
  When did the delivery occur?
  Oh, I just got paint on my new shirt!
  Is it really free?
  Because fish are easy to take care of. For example, just let them swim in a tank of water and feed them a couple of times a day.
  Isn't bathing good for hygiene.
  I couldn't have chosen a better house, if it wasn't for agent Jones help.
  But I'm listening to it.
  Is it not raining today?
  No, the ones with the fat cat eating bacon in his recliner or talking to real people.
  No, there is a convenience store in front of my house.
  She did meet up with you.
  I have to be at the airport between 10:30 and 10:35.
  Why don't you go to the library?
  That's all.
  I can go with you.
  No, I am very good at math.
  I can help you. What is the name of the insured?
  
  There is a savings account and a money market account available.
  That’s no fun, let’s go to sleep!
  No. Let me check my balance on "BankingApp"
  Sending a Tweet will change the world. Sending a Tweet "can" save a life, or end a war.
  I think the earth would be better off if we all just got naked
  Are you able to turn your neck fully to the left and right without pain?
  That's a good question. Well I think the cypress trees give a great accent to the development.
  What are they?
  Well, that's no reason not to have to pay for the ticket. I would expect you to pay it anyway.
  A university in a safe area? Let's see.
  I am sure that I did install it correctly; you can look at the manual for yourself!
  My mother said I can't go out because my brand new, white shoes are dirty.
  You mean like if I want to buy it, I have to pay him more cash?
  You can ask me anything after this sentence.
  Thank you.
  What do you really think?
  I'm sorry.
  Looks like you've been crying again.
  You don't think it's her fault, do you?
  Like how?
  You can use our computers at the library, I've heard it's free.
  Good. I hope the Rays win again.
  How much money do you think you will be able to raise?
  They don't talk about anything.
  I'm in the living room. Where are you?
  There is no washer or dryer in your apartment, but you have access to them.
  I'm sorry, but we require that all new customers open a checking account
  I'm sorry to hear that. If there's anything I can do to help, let me know.
  You should be happy that you can say that.
  Nuh uh.
  Impossible, you get sugar there.
  I don't even have a car, why will you give me a ticket?
  What's a calling card?
  Thunder follows after lightning, with a certain interval of time.
  So do you like to see famous people fail time and again?
  What'd you do with the paper?
  They say: "An apple a day keeps the doctor away".
  I know it sucks, but you have the choice to stay there or not.
  There are no cars around.
  You should think about what you are studying.
  What is that supposed to mean? 
  Why do we live?
  I have to go somewhere after the run.
  Nice to meet you Lisa. I am Jane.
  Are we in agreement then?
  There are no words in your language.
  You can if you have enough money to pay for that transfer.
  Are you ok?
  I've been watching TV, (I've been watching and "I am watching" and "I will be watching".)
  Each door has a lock on it.
  Those were the last three.
 
  I would rather not get lost.
  What do you paint?
  I love you, too.
  I had a hard time with that one too and this is how I did it:
  Congratulations! When are you guys moving in?
  Why big news?
  Oh, that's nothing. You should see what's on my steak!
  Are we talking about the same thing?
  I've always had this plan that I wanted to be buried.
  Where can I download it? 
  I loved it, too. It is a great book, but it is a little bit sad, too.
  
  Let's watch a DVD.
  You are going to be a pharmacist. 
  I think you're rude.
  Does it come with both?
  How's that possible?
  Pick the one you need.
  I love Motown music.
  Take 15. But get off at the last stop.
  I can help you with that.
  Well, if they say so.
  Yes, that's true. There are different languages used to sing opera - Italian, French, German, Russian, English, Latin, Chinese, Japanese, Arab, Ethiopic, Hungarian, Finnish, Korean, Czech, Hebrew,
  Would you type in your checking account information?
  I'm looking forward to your first text message.
  So you're Michael?
  Great. I'll schedule you for 6:30.
  Oh, there is a car behind me! Move to the right and go.
  She is an exceptionally careless person.
  I liked dinner a lot. Everyone was sitting around the table.
  Do you know... (starts blabbing on about something Person2 doesn't really care about) Person2:   (tries to interject, Person1 cuts him/her off) Person1:   What do you think?
  And paid.
 Be more responsible.
 Why? Do you mean constructing or finding stores?
  Are you flake?
  There was a red light?!
  I like biking and running. I'm training by running every day and trying to avoid unsalted food during nighttime.
  But it's cheaper.
 What exactly is it that you don't like about them?
  Why, Person2, I don't think the neighbors will even notice if we decorate this year.
  Have you read our FAQs?
  OK, but it's not good for you.
  The doctor said that he is obese.
  Sorry.
  That's a really bad idea. Did you report it?
   Not bluffing. It's my tile and the color of the card is 5 and red, I can show it to you.
  I like it.
  Then why didn’t you say so
  I just wanted to express how grateful we all are for the class.
  That is not normal.
  Don't overwork yourself. 
  Got it.
  Do they work there?
  Yup. They have special cleaning fluid in them.
  Yes. I've already applied for the apartment.
  No, I don't like those. It's about cooking food.
  I've tried a little of it.
  You always say "wash your hands before having food". The water from the washbasin is just as clean as the bathwater. The tap water also comes out clean, and you make me drink it. Now, how dirty must it be? (The logic Person1 has used is known as "conditional reasoning", and is a form of formal logical fallacy; if water is dirty, it can still come out clean).
  At least it's not as bad as Los Angeles.
  But you didn't damage the pen, right?
  I know. What if someone slips?
  About 3 years ago.
  I like to hit the ball and run around the bases.
  Why are you such a worried iguana?
 
  I do not know if it is working or not, but press me.
  Do you know that this stuff isn't supposed to be salt and pepper???
  It could lead to a serious injury.
  I'm not sure. I think it is green now.
  More people should be like you.
  It's not so hot today so you must be saying that because you felt like it.
  The verandah faces the sunrise.
  Get in line. Don't worry, the driver will accept the fare when you reach the front.
  
  Sure does. My grandma always gives me the extra money she saves from not spending on food to buy the ingredients for the rice cake.
  Oh, I'm disappointed to hear that!
  The location of the cockroach(s)?
  It isn't bad because it's better than nothing.
  It doesn't look like there will be any rain.
  I guess that's a consideration.
  I’ll bring my charger next time.
  I think you should eat something healthy.
  Who was robbed?
  Not really though.
  I put my bag on the chair.
  No, actually, I have another example. My sister is 19 years old and she stills lives with my parents. That's because she thinks my parents are the "best" parents. She says they give her whatever she wants...
  Aren't you allowed to mail it in?
  Don't the heat waves cool down at night? 
  Do you know how fast you were going back there?
  The father gave the speaker a nice gift.
  A dalmatian.
  Now that's a nice scream.
  Why did they discriminate against you?
  Yes, she is breathing alright.
  Why couldn't you sleep at 11 p.m.?
  Hurray, congratulations! 
  What type of claim are you filing?
  Let's go to the shop right across from here. It seems accessible.
  I can make a cash offer.
  Well, I never "got" it.
  I should think about buying a new laptop.
  Do you have an account number?
  What do you mean?
  9085.
  So, s/he might be very hot even when it's snowing outside.
  Ok, I know where that is.
  "You can never have too many apples!".
 
  There will be a doctor here to take the blood.
  I know. We need to do some yard work before then.
  I just like staying at home these days.
  Bill, may I get you a cup of coffee?
  [ ]! Person2:  [ ]...
  I was wondering if you could give me advice about that.
 An air rifle would make a fantastic gift.
  How many people go to this restaurant?
  I'd like us to return home soon.
  Do the teachers burn the chairs and desks.
  You look terrible.
  Regardless of your opinion on Obama, logic dictates they must love themselves.
  What do you mean by that?
  Omg, that's horrible. Does it have a name?
  Death is inevitable.
  I often wonder if there is some systematic trick to it.
 Ah, they sell it in the rice section.
  There are 24 hours every day.
  Say it ain't so, Joe!
  I wish I wanted to go into that store, but I don't.
  No, not really. 
  Hold on, let me check. Here it is, muni route number 4722, the boyle street bus.
  "good things" for me is when my mom cooks really good stuff.
  So how long do we have before the concert starts?
  Turn of the light.
  That's not true!
  The guy from the car accident.
  In France, people eat things other than basil.
  How does it happen?
  
  This is my real friends. You are fake!
  You mean he didn't have gloves on?
  Sure. There's a new bus stop just outside of the library, there isn't one of course but you will be able to buy an annual pass.
  No, but can I help you find out?.
  That's fantastic.
  Maybe, the operating system is a bit too smart.
  Wow! That would be great.
  Try me.
  Yes, but I don't know you very well.
  No problem. I'll be right down. I live on the first floor, so it will be easier for me to show you around. 
  Excuse me. What does it mean?
  It is a new law.
  How is it inconvenient?
  We disagree. You wrote the check on the wrong account.
  Nope, you need to tell me.
  You never know unless you try.
  I bought it.
  Yes, it would take an hour to explain how dumb that is.
 Yes, but it will be even better when the sun comes out.
  I was really happy when I managed to get a parking spot.
  Because of the chest pain? 
  Nope. 
  Where is it?
  I said she was bad.
  I think Mary bought a stock for $10.
  What a shame!
  They say they did not receive my payment.
  You'll never guess what happened.
  Just give it a try. It's very yummy. You'll love it!
  My wife, Linda, and I bought our home in 2003.
  Perhaps I should go and look at that dress.
  Why is he rude?
  It's a golf club turned into a. . .
  I wasn't trying to embarrass you
  No.
  But I don't know what you've liked in the past.
  Where did you fly? 
  That is ridiculous.
  So do you.
  Who is it? 
  Elementary, middle, or high school?
 
  Are you sure?
  I don't know. 
  I think it's because we're both the kind of people who like to talk a lot about ourselves.
  Do you know what field of biology you want to specialize in?
  I agree with you.
  Not to make you feel bad but we have seen hundreds of them.
  No, not at all, here it is.
  Do you promise or do it or what?
  Oh, I see. How are you going to ask for help if you don't have any money?
 That's where I can help you. I have Internet access at home, so you are welcome to use it.
  You've still got a better chance without me.
  Yes, there is a bit. If you intend to be a long-term guest, then you need to park within the borders of the motel. You also need to tell us whether or not you will need to park your car at the facility each night you’re away from it. In case you can’t find space, you might have to go elsewhere.
  Okay, cool.
  It was just text message.
  That's not so great. Feeling sick is no good. If it gets worse, you really need to see a doctor. You can't just treat it with just something like chicken soup or cold water.
  Isn't it obvious?
   Oh, let me ask him. 
  He was in a good mood.
  I know how to make souffle. However, I've never made it. So, I am unable to tell the exact time needed to make it.
  The debt you accrued regarding services rendered.
  How do you like ice-cream?
  We have savings accounts that offer different interest rates based on the balance you keep in the account.
  I bet prisoners would love to see it in your purse.
  I don't drink alcohol.
  My aunt went to a doctor, and she said it cost too much money.
  He was my homeroom teacher when I was at primary school.
  I was reaching for a Kleenex.
  I don't know, it's too close to the TV.
  What is it?
  I tell you what was funny?
  Do you go to the movies?
  How much balance do you have in it?
  Do you think we should get one?
  That's a great idea! Meet me at the hotel lobby after breakfast. We can leave for the city together.
  I don't know.
  the next one is the last one that I will ever take from you
  When you say that, it sounds as if having a lot of schooling is not a good thing.
  Aren't babies a handful?
  Do you think the nurse believed your story.
  It's not that much of a hassle, though.
  We need to leave plenty of time.
  Can't you apply to a medical school?
  The front door is lockable and so is the back door
 Sure. Where do you need to go?
  It's about 6 miles.
  No, it does not. The last time I came here was two years ago, but that was at Easter. I can't tell if it looks the same from this picture alone.
  It's my first time to be in Hong Kong.
  First name?
  No, I'm afraid I can't.
  Well, I like Smith.
  How do you go there?
  Yeah. I hope they can make it easier to open next time.
  Yes, sometimes.
  Who cares about the law? I wanna buy something then I will.
  No, I put a dollar into 
  Where did you get this?
  It has to be a good one.
 No, it doesn't. I was a member of the tennis team two years ago.
  Whatever. They are just shoes.
  I'm not sure.
  What did you do before this?
  Are you sure you want to ask me?
  Is that so?
  How were you as a painter?
  That makes sense. 
  The smell of the room was bad.
  I take public transportation frequently.
  What are they going to do?
  Why not?
  Okay. But will you be the only one in your room?
  Yes it is.
  Lisa, you are beautiful.
  I can bake the cake tomorrow if that’s OK with you.
  No, I'm playing the game on the NDS (Nintendo Ds)
  They're just afraid of you.
  A
  I still think that I am not mature enough to get a job.
  You can swin in half an hour.
  You get what you deserve.
 I see, I understand.
  Isn’t it cute? The protagonist is so unrequited.
  Do you need to go to hospital?
  I bet you could fry an egg on the sidewalk!
  Where does it take place? 
  Do you have any hobbies?
  Do you have another passport?
  Why would I be stereotypical?
  The bank will simply debit your account for an amount that is larger than the money you have now.
  Oh. Maybe they'll come to my country.
  Only one can talk at a time.
  I’m in the Metro Park district. It is easy to access when I go to work or when I go grocery shopping.
  I'm trying to listen to it, but you keep saying my name.
  Wow. I wish I could cut myself. It looks like it feels good.
  He got a bad review?
  The effects and storyline were great, and the fighting scenes were amazing.
  That sounds good.
  I am sure.
  Maybe the beach some weekend.
  Actually, I was using the ball in the game. 
  I'm a bit surprised because you've been saying how good you've been getting at keeping track of time since your last bad incident.
  Ok. What do I need to bring?
  One of them was 4.5 pounds and the other one was 7 pounds.
 Okay give me the money.
  I can help you find one if you want.
  It will help you with your personal statement.
 I'm scared of them because they have multiple heads.
  Let me be the judge of that.
  And that's a good thing?
  What other flags?
  You might need to show at least $5,000 in cash or liquid assets.
  I'm sorry, I didn't know.
  Why? I would love to move in here.
  That's my size.
  How are the students in your class?
  So you can see that's a perfect example of a homonym.
  I went to the store before you did.
  Wow. How many bedrooms are in your new house?
  Yeah I'd say so.
  I've been here for several years, but the new neighbors are living here for almost three months.
  I know it is, but I found it at a department store right before it went out of stock.
  No, it's been a while. I'll pay.
  I love them both. I get along with Mom more than Dad, but both of them are great.
  No. I have been busy today.
  He's a real jerk!
  Let's leave it as it is.
 
  We've noticed you've been taking out $100 per week. What's that for?
  Oh really? What was breakfast like?
  What are you doing with your old car?
  I already let the pheasant and the juneberry out. 
  She is unconscious and has a racing heart.
  I think I'm going to have steak for dinner today.
  Who goes to London?
  It's my job to help everyone. Let me try.
  It was a fine game. The score ended up being 3-0.
  I can't enter the pool without them.
  Of course.
  Huh? 
  Did you go into the triathlon?
  I left the car door open and a flower pot fell on it.
  The Beatles, Godsmack, John Mayer, Led Zeppelin, Nirvana, The Rolling Stones, Tool, Incubus.
  I'm thinking of chatting with my mom on it.
  What do you mean?
  I'd like a house salad, please.
  But it is on the other side on the river.
 They did not want to go out with me.
  Exactly the same way?
  The cat is hungry. I'll feed him in a minute.
  But not everyone does.
 
  I'm hungry.
  I would not...
  Am I taking the bus downtown?
  My shift is from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m.
  I guess it means you are the type of person who never goes to parties, or something. You don't look like you would go out much....
  I might go to bed; I am pretty tired.
  Okay, we'll go out to dinner at 5:00 and be at the airport around 7:00.
  I don't see why.
  Is it still raining?
  I want to give him some Tylenol.
 It is cold.
  Is a phone an online account?
  It looks a little bit too cold. I might not go swimming.
  What happens on Election Day?
  It's not an A, it's a B.
  I don’t have a car.

  Great, I've been thinking about trying that new restaurant down the street.
  You need to know which stop you want and the number on the bus so you know which is yours. 
  What is the purpose of your visit?
  Maggi2go is good when you're in a hurry. 
 
  That's terrible. What happened?
  Then, Person2, do you like soccer?
  Did you ask her if she wanted anything?
  I’d like an Earl Grey tea, please.
  Was it not 65?
  That's not good; you should be eating more.
  We would need to have your original passport or an original driver's license.
  The mouse ran across the floor.
  Have you told him?
  Thank you. How are you?
Person2:
  That's bad.
  It's so weird how some people are prepared to pay so much for hair products.
  That's good. Hm, I wonder what to order?
  Well, you can go out and get it today.
  I broke my leg a week ago.
  I did when I was in elementary school. I think I scored a little over 120.
  Well, I need a basket to mount the ball.
  It's not of good quality.
  Well I would find that second person attractive.
  What is Mother's Day?
  I enjoyed my meal.
  
  If I’d had my way, they would have done this or that.
  Can I give you another one?
  Can you tell me something?
  Part of it is still cruddy.
  I don't know how to use some program.
  Actually, I was hoping to talk to James about a summer job.
  She said I was using it too much, so she took it away.
  I’ll think about it
  It's just two blocks away from here.
  You'll have to ask the sheep.
  They read their Bible. Person2:   Why can't Person1 pray with Person2?
  I have a paper cut on my finger.
  Same with that low-down snake. 
  You'll never make it. It's too far away.
  I forgot my passport.
  Thank goodness. I really appreciate it.
 I'm going running.
  Wow, it's beautiful.
  I know this from my years of experience.
  Ever since my dad got promoted, he has been spending more time at work.
  I feel it's kinda strange to be going on a date with a member of the opposite sex when I'm married
  I'm bringing out the candles. It's so dark, I feel like it's night time already.
  I'll try this place called Club Steakhouse.
  The train is leaving in 5mins
  Did you read it?
  Was an artist?
  I'm quite busy at the moment. Can I read it next week?
  The city council already decided to add a tax to Internet use.
 Really? That's outrageous. You should be able to pay that without selling anything extra.
  So many things! First, I'm really looking forward to finally meeting you in person after talking with you via email and Skype for so long. Secondly, I want to get to know Tijuana better. Lastly, I just want some good Mexican food! 
  OK, you are all set. Here is your new debit card. Would you like to apply for overdraft protection?
  First, take Bus 11. Then from there take Bus 17.
  It tastes like ground-up astronaut shoes.
   What color is it?
  You know what they say, the more the merrier.
  Go to the Board of Elections office.
  She's a nurse. 
  I need to finish this first.
  Well, yeah...
  I did some studying and watched TV.
  How is the weather?
  I told you not to expect too much. That was pretty clear at the last meeting.
  I knew we would have a great time.
  I love watching people.
  I mean cute small nose like yours, not like mine.
  I told you.
  What are you referring to?
  David! It's past your bed time and you haven't cleaned your room yet.
  I know it's unfair. I deeply apologize.
  Yes, "he went through the red light".
  I am at Bank of America.
  Something stylish. In that case, you should pick up a nice shirt.
  You can take Route #5. There should be a bus coming along any minute now.
  A free CD-ROM!
 
  I went to the health club.
 It's been proven that if one does not know the location of something they have lost, they never truly lose it. In other words, if you find out where you had last seen it, then you will be able to find it again. Therefore the answer is "you've already found it".
   You planned to stay in this house for the next 100 years.
  It's probably be another half hour.
  They're selling food there, if you want to eat.
  No, but I hear it's very beautiful.
  Then pick the science class.
  That is true, but why do you think the government should legally establish it?
  So you know how the other day I told you about how Jacob had to stay up all night trying to fix his router?
  Not necessarily. You may pay for it or you can pay per hour or use it free if you are willing to volunteer at the student union.
  If it did rain, tomorrow would be a good day to go out.
 Really? What did I leave in my car last night?
  I didn't know you voted in the election.
  Oh, right, because of your asthma.
  You hate that bed, don't you?<br>
  I think that Person2 is uncomfortable with this one. Person2:   I don't want that one. Person1:  Person2 doesn't want that one either.
  How about the theatre?
  Are you free on Thursday afternoon?
  The party was a success.
  You're breaking up with me.
  I had seven.
  I don't want to talk about it.
  That's not the look of a bubble
  I'll give you $30 for it.
  You look like you need some vitamin C.
  I guess neither do I, then.
  Karma will get her.
  How about McDonald’s?
  No, not that I remember.

  He said it felt like I had some sort of "inhibitor."
  I bought them at the jewelry store.
  I know.
  Your car?
  I don't know.
  What do you mean?
  Yeah. Locations like that really seem like they might be on the list of resort areas. Anyway, it's not like you're wrong; there are some amazing places near here.
  Do you take this bus to school every day?
 
  Shall we say at 1:30?
  Does that mean you're working at two different places?
  You'll eventually get used to it. I think it's better to go to an international school so you can meet people from different countries and interact with them.
  Do you like spicy foods?
  I can't help you. The database is attached to my computer and it will take me a long time to create the same file, find all the data and then download it to your computer.
  There's pasta.
  That sucks! Umm, have you studied? I’m not sure how you managed to forget.
  Why? That's never been an issue before.
  Then let me do it.
  You can get a hot dog or a hamburger.

  No. That's also not a surfboard.
  To kill harmful insects.
  Did you catch something at school?
  Oh, no thank you.

  I'm feeling a little peckish.
  I'm sure you'll do well. Here's a hug to help calm you down.
  
  Yes, Mr. Jones.
   A deck with kickers and rails, if you want to get technical.
  What do you mean?
  I know it's not.
  Pregnant?
  I can work overtime tonight.
  Not my ATM card.
  It could have been a whistle.
  Life is strange.
 I hope so, the man deserves it.
  (raised voice) Seriously?!
  But you are not sure.
  Yeah, the green one is for papers and the black one is for trash.
  It must take a long time to find the right site.
  They have 1 day passes, 3 day passes and 1 month passes. You can get a 1 day pass for $5 or a 1 month pass for $50.
  Wow, I would never do such a thing.
  I'm sure you do.
  I presume you are a member?
  It's a Sunday today, and on a Sunday you stay in bed all day. 
  Let me check my calendar.
  I have heartburn,lightheadedness,nausea,and diarrhea.
  You have never had any experience.
  Great! How many cards do you want?
  I plead not guilty.
  I don't know. What order is it?
  I am chewing on some pork meat.
  You cant be trusted then.
  I know, isn't it funny? Maybe if I wasn't always around she would have dated more.
  You certainly hit a white ball.
  Are we all going to the concert?
  Once you exit, look for this sign.
  Well, but it isn't a fancy restaurant either.
  Which account would you like to transfer the money from?
  Rather, I feel better now!
  We're having a sale on sweet potatoes.
  I don't have time to make it look pretty. There's no Fashion Police in front of bike helmets...
  Anemia is an insufficient amount of red blood cells.
  How old is he?
  My name is Person1.
  I'm just not in the mood.
 How does it taste?
  It's well-calculated so that it's enough to keep you awake when you finish dinner, though.
   That’s deep.
 The red ones will get big and remain red, but the green ones won't get bigger, right?
  No, you haven't. All of my friends say it all the time, don't you remember?
  When did you start dating?
 The car isn't here?
  We will need to take out a mortgage.
  Of course! I don't like you either!
  I'm just not very hungry.
  All of them. They belong to me.
  I'll show you. Two times two is four.
  Let's try anyway.
  I know, but that's how it's written on my calendar.
  Good thing we have a spare key!
  It is just the way things are done.
  You're welcome.
   Wow.
  Stop complaining and roll onto your back!
  No. I have an assignment to make up. It's a really long paper about my favorite singer.
  It's not dirty, it looks fine.
  It's only mud. 
  What the what? 
  Oh yes, now I remember.
  Certainly, sir. Ladies scarves are grouped together here, and over here we have a nice collection of men's scarves.
  Okay, John, since you already have an account with us, I'll just charge your credit card kshs...
  Give me a break. We had a good discussion last night. I told you I was voting for him.
 Okay. We can build sand castles without sand.
  Yes.
  When I am feeling good,
  We should only proxy vote if we cannot vote.
  Maybe you will get a fever.
  I told you it was on my desk.
  It is a term used to describe the weight gained by a college student during their first year at a university.
  What do you mean by an "everything" job?
  I want to play basketball.

  Cool. I hope everyone gets along and we all learn a lot of new and interesting things.
  My way of looking at it is, I’d rather ask for forgiveness than permission.

  But I don't have a Facebook account.
  Oh. Really?
  A new show I like is on.
  It's hard and big and red and long and dirty and ugly and (pissed off).

  I'm not rejecting you at all.
  Your suitcase?
  It is like an iPod. It is like an iPod, but for your tap tyres.
  I like your name Lisa.
  I'm sure that is better.
  It's perfect.
  Congratulations on your new position.
  She was nice.
  Sure, is there anything else you'd like?
  Because it is said that Martin Luther King is a racist.
  I know what to have tonight.
  How can you tell?
  Uhhhh. . . no.
   Well, at least try to enjoy this last beer.
  I'm so glad to hear that you want to look for a job.
  I see...Here you go.

  I don't really feel like packing up, moving to Canada, and then freezing half to death.
  You've got to do it.

  Tell me about it, Mom.
  I would like to leave LAX on 10/4/2007
  How much is that gonna cost me?
  What about "The Daily Telegraph"?
  Yes, but what is the source of this knowledge?
  Is it blood?
  It's on the other side of the river .
  What do you want to eat?
  I saw. Person2:   Have you seen?
  We lost a lot of players, but we still have Luck.
  No, no I did not.

  What are you going to do with all that cash?
  What is the address of the location?
  I must have missed it. What happened?

  I don't get it. How do you know these things? I thought only the police knew about the bank robbery...

  I am on a very strict diet. Oatmeal, fruits, vegetables, lean meats.
  Was it a university?
  You mean, besides America.
  Yes, one is for paper and the other is for plastic.
  Like Blue Bayou.
  Not yet. What did you bring?
  Two years ago, I did not have anything.

  You should speak English.
  In which case maybe we could go cold and warm.
  I am sorry sir.
  I have been here for a good while. Where is your house?
  Haha, we don't fight. Actually we live in the same house and go to the same school (they take care of us). It's like we're siblings.
  It's a kind of a brisk, but cold night.
  Are you sure?
  He was the third person in the line.
  How much time do you spend playing video games?
  Yeah. I liked the pictures and the charts, however there was too much text and not enough details. You need to work on that; we're also lacking your opinion.
  We watched that new romantic drama at the theatre. It wasn't a chick flick or anything like that; we both enjoyed it very much.
 Oh, we must tell someone we care about.
  Thank you for bringing that to our attention.
  Cool. What time should we start?
  Let's not step on that.
 I don’t live near the bus stop.
  Do you want to come with me?

  My hands and arms.
  But you have to look into the classrooms that are overcrowded.
  No, they are over the counter.
  How about if I explore the jungle instead?

  What did you do?
  Not long.

 But I've been dating Dorothy since third grade.

  Any other complaints?
  Don't you think this should be reported to the organization running the competition?
  I brought you a yellow rose.
  No, I don't.
  How much did the ticket cost?
  No, not really. I wasn't all that impressed with the appetizer.

 The wind blew my keys away.
  No, it's open 6am - 10pm on weekdays and 9am - 5pm on weekends.
  Thanks, but no.
  Not just that, but it's good exercise. It can be eye-opening if you fish in different types of water.
  What would you do if you did not have a job?
  He's coming closer!
  Never even seen it on television.
  What were you doing here?
  Huh?
  We are moving your furniture now.
  Well, if she eats nothing but that, then she'll grow into a macaroni!
   I find thinking about it calms me down. 
  Well maybe next time I will have a simple salad too.

  I need to patch some holes.
  A disaster!

  One night, I’ll be arriving Friday night.
  Where will you do it?
 At how old can you start thinking about your retirement?
  I'm down for shopping.
  So next semester we will be able to transfer and take Intermediate English.
  That is a good choice.
  I mean, you won't make me do anything.
  Tiger? What happened to Tiger.
  It's bland.
  Where did you get all your stuff?
  What about the quality of your food?

  I think I will not go back to work.
  Because you're a slut, that's why.
  The chair.
  Do you like peanut butter and jelly sandwiches?
  Not really. Actually it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. It was just another zombie show, nothing special.
  You do that. I’m going to bed.
  I fail to see how that remark advances our conversation.
  Let me see what I can do.
  No, that's okay. I can find you in our database.
  Fantastic! How many people are in your reservation?
 
  Why did you do so?

  A great big fucking mess that will never work right.
  No, I did not.
  It’s a game on Facebook.
  Well, I don't have any.
  It's not broken, is it? I need to play tomorrow!

  Well, I guess you can do that.
  I didn't know I needed those.

  The city bus and the island bus.
  I come to this restaurant twice a week because I have discovered that the fish is really fresh here.
