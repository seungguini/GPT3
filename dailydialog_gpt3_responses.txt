  let ' s say you are being interviewed for a position of choosing manager . first, you should give an introduction about yourself, then give some details about the company, next you should talk about your job experiences , and tell us what experience can be applied into that position. you should also present which skills you have in order to choosing the right person for the job

 fresh air is the best kind of air. i for one love to do outdoor activities . you can hit the beach , hike amongst the mountains, or just walk amongst the summer breeze . the fresh air makes it so you don't feel tired or stressed during your activities. Person2: i totally agree . fresh air keeps one healthy . trees are especially good for the air . they clean the air with oxygen .
 hmm . huan huan is certainly very cute , but she looks a little sick or unhealthy . she has yellow skin .

 I wonder what we should have for lunch .
  Oh ! You mean like the poems we learned in elementary school ?
 Does it matter ?

 It's that charity concert organized by the local Salvation Army, and it will be held at that community center . It's happening downtown .
 Oh, why ?
 I’m cool !
 What did you say ?
 Based on your description of it , I don't think that I am interested .
 I'm looking up your account and I see you have a free upgrade to HD+ right now . Normally we'd charge $ 4 .99 for HD and $ 5 .99 for HD+ .
 You're jealous that your team is even worse than mine ! Salsbury may be the city with the worst sports teams in the nation , but for once you're not in last place . 
 You seem to be annoyed (by the traffic). I thought you were enjoying (the trip-it wasn't your destination).
 Look at him, everything can make him happy , as if he is a kid .
 He'll pay you back as soon as he gets a job .
 It's a special kind of rock . It is softer than most stones and heavier than most rocks .
 OK . I'll be back in a few minutes .

 You made the call to your Mom .

  Have you ever worked as an operator before ?
 The book is called "Law" and the author is Legally Dead".

 Yes ,I am . May I sit down , please ?
  Ok, I'll ask my sister .
 Greenhorn , what are you talking about ? I’m feeling disturbed for some reason.
 What ? I don't understand .

 Shall I order two coffees?
 I see . Japan is famous not only for anime , manga , but also many other things .
 I don't buy it .
  What a diamond in the rough !
 No,ot yet.
 And I said: No , I won't be able to make it .
 But at this time I can not find the money .
 I'm so sorry . My mother has been really sick recently . I must have overlooked or forgot to pick up my ticket .
 I will have them back to you by 10 o clock this morning .
 Well , our income should be fine . Just leave all the arithmetic to me .
 I think it can be OK . 
 My name is Lisa . Nice to meet you !
 
 I was trying to pull out of my parking space.
 How much is that other one over there ?
 One-way.
 I agree with you there . I just don't know if this is the best time .
 an old Tapioca-chicken noodle plate , it is actually not too far . 
  Huh ? Is "ja" written in black on yellow ?

 So , yesterday they were advertising it at ninety-five dollars .
  I'm sorry to hear that . 
 Awesome that's really cool .
 I don't care. I want meat
 My , how did you do that ?
  Certainly . Take your time .
 Well, there are many online stores that sell items cheaper than the ones in the retail shops .
 I'll be ready then .
  You may place your first bag ( carry-on ) and the suitcase ( checked ) on the conveyor belt .
  Yes .
 I hear what you're saying , but what is your stance on gay marriage, because if you're against it , then I don't feel the same way about you and we need to talk about this so we can work through it .
 Okay , but let's not be hasty this time . We should, at the very least , say no to that ring-dang doodle . And then we can always order people some more drinks after some important sporting events.
 ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
 Yes, qq and in today's class we study .
 Uh-oh , what happened ?

  Go on
 Yes , you could do it right now .
 You get your bus pass?

 It is playful like Sarah . Did she decorate it herself ?
 Mr . Cooper , Ms . Wang will be in charge of preparing for the conference next week .
 It's easy listening AM radio . I enjoy it as a site to just chill and relax.

 Ok . Here's your aisle seat . I hope you enjoy the flight to Chicago .
 Why doesn't he ask her ?
 I've already had several girlfriends .
 I'd like to speak with him. May I take a message for you ?
 Well , Jim, I am of the feeling that computers are better than books because people are able to explore many levels at once. A person can use a cross-reference of reference, which is more complex for humans, but not impossible even though it is considered impossible by some.
 那也不要太大，我有很多鞋子。
 That's so cool ! 
 I do not . I was just hungry .
 The airline has additional duties to the traveler, so the airline is unable to issue a refund or credit . You can change your departure date with the airline through the web site of the airline .

 I was volunteering with an organization that helped homeless people .

 It's cool .
 Sure , come with me.
 Classical music calms me down and allows me to think clearly about things I need to do .
